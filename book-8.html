<p>Everything But the Truth is a brilliantly compelling thriller about how much - or how little - we can trust the ones we love. 'Packed with twists and turns that will make it almost impossible to put down!' Hello! 'Twisty and emotionally charged. Breathlessly brilliant' Heat It all started with the email.
