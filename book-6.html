<p>PREORDER THE NEW BOOK FROM DAISY STYLES NOW** In the Phoenix Munitions Factory everyone has their secrets ...As WWII rolls across Europe, Kitty boards a ship set for England; leaving her cruel father for war work in a munitions factory. She hadn't wanted to leave Ireland, but the money sounded too good to resist. And money is what she really needs right now, what with tiny baby Billy back in Dublin without a father. In Lancashire Kitty settles into the hard work and soon makes new friends; the dazzling Gladys who is a talented musician, and the beautiful but nervous Violet who seems to be nursing a secret of her own. And then there is motherly Edna at the local chippy, always there for a cup of tea and a good natter when she yearns for home. Working hard in the day and playing in the Bomb Girls Swing Band by night, on the surface, life seems to be looking up. But Kitty has kept a secret from her friends. Something she needs to figure out. And when a letter arrives from home, she realises she might need their help before it's too late and she loses her baby forever ...Praise for Daisy Styles 'All the ingredients for a cracking story with truly endearing characters' Annie Murray, bestselling author of Now The War Is Over 'An absolute joy to read' Kate Thompson, bestselling author of Secrets of the Sewing Bee</p>
