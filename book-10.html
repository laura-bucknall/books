<p>I hope you're ready for an adventure. Twenty-eight year old Hannah certainly is. She and her colleagues are in Spain for a month to film a documentary, and it's a dream come true. Not least because Hannah will get to spend long summer days with Theo, her boss (and crush). If only Tom (Hannah's best friend and cameramen) and Claudette (the presenter) would stop getting in the way...Then things become even more complicated when Nancy, Hannah's half-sister arrives. What is she doing here? For once in her life, can't Hannah just have one perfect summer, free of any drama?</p>
